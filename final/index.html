  <p class="problem-para">In recent years, there has been increasing acknowledgement of the important role mental health 
    plays in achieving global development goals, as illustrated by the inclusion of mental health in the 
    Sustainable Development Goals. Depression is one of the leading causes of disability. 
    Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds. People with severe mental health conditions 
    die prematurely  as much as two decades early  due to preventable physical conditions. Mental health problems can affect a student's energy level, concentration, dependability, mental ability, and optimism, hindering performance. Over the past few decades, mental illness has been extensively increased among students.
    Anxiety, depression, eating disorders, psychotics, and mood swings are the most common symptoms that cannot be ignored.
     According to mental health research conducted by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), one in four students has a diagnosable mental illness.

  <p class="sucide-para">How Common Is Suicide and Suicidal Feelings Among College Students?
    Suicide is the third leading cause of death for 15-24 year olds
    In a recent national survey, 10.3% of college students reported that they seriously considered suicide in the past 12 months Many students come to college with a prior history of mental health difficulties or treatment. Environmental stressors in combination with a predisposition to experience mental health problems may increase risk for suicide. In a recent national survey 16% of college students reported being diagnosed with a depressive disorder, many within the last year. Over 90% of persons who commit suicide have a diagnosable mental disorder, typically a depressive disorder or substance abuse disorder. Men are especially at risk for completed suicide. College age men are four to six times more likely to die by suicide than women. Women are two to three times more likely to attempt suicide using nonlethal means than men.
